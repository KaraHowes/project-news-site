# News Site

I decided to try to build a Newspaper for children and so styled accordinlgy. The aim was not to be condescending, but to inspire Children to be the best they can be. I opted to use Flex box to mkae the site responsive


## The problem
For the first project I wanted to try to keep things simple, so that I didn't confuse myself. I opted to use flex box. The header would have a logo and nav bar at full-screen, but on smaller screens a Hamburger would appear and the logo would not be displayed.
My layout had one main news image, with the text wrapping underneath on smaller screens. I made one news card, with all images in the same orientation. This cards were responsive. 
If I had more time I would have used grid, but I just didn't feel that I had enough time to learn how to use it (and also thought one 3-minute pre-recorded lecture was not enough)
